title: What's Next

Step Forge is still early in development and we have some big features planned. If you are interested in helping out, our GitHub is a great place to start.

## Upcoming Features

- Build time dependency analysis (right now this only works in the VS Code extension)
- A Step Forge specific test runner (that is not Cucumber)
- Inferred parsers
- Reduce/remove need for state generics
